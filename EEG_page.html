                            The project is about enable patients who can only lie in bed to "click" a button through this brain-computer interface by just staring at it.

                            During expiriments, I designed the flickering light blocks as visual stimuli. 
                            Then, different frequency were encoded in each stimulus in order to generate different characteristics in signal. 
                            The subjects were asked to wear an electrode cap and look at different flickering lights by vocal instruction. 
                            The EEG signals were recorded by the electrons and sent to computer through Arduino chip.
                            I used Matlab to process the EEG signal to find the characteristics. 
                            Finally, I checked if these characteristics were correspondent to the stared stimulus' tag.

                            The most difficult part of this project is signal processing. 
                            The visual stimulated EEG signal is much weaker in forehead compared to the one detected in hindbrain. 
                            Yet, placing electrodes in hindbrain is already inconvenient for healthy subjects, let alone patients who can only lie in bed.
                            I used techniques such like superposition to reduce random noice and enhence the characteristic in signal.
                            The accuracy of predicting which button the subject was staring at is up to 70% during testing phase.

                            1. Filter out the white noise caused by other appliances.

                            2. Cut EEG signals into epochs, which means signal with shorter time durations.

                            I collected EEG signals from FPz(forehead), Oz(hindbrain), A1(left ear), A2(right ear).

                        <p>
                            During processing, I could also see that the signal magnitude gradually decreased from hindbrain to forehead, which demonstrates the EEG signal is indeed generated from hindbrain.
